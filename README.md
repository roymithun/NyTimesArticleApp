[![NyTimes Article App](https://img.shields.io/badge/V1.0-Article%20App-green)](https://github.com/roymithun/NyTimesArticleApp/releases/download/v1.0/app-release.apk)

## Pre-requisites
Most Popular API from [nytimes developer](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) have been used.

For example: https://api.nytimes.com/svc/mostpopular/v2/mostviewed/all-sections/7.json?api-key=yourkey

Where your_key has to be generated following [get-started](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) page from nytimes.

Once you have yourkey, please add a new entry in **local.properties** inside your project directory. Since local.properties is added in [.gitignore](https://github.com/roymithun/NyTimesArticleApp/blob/master/.gitignore). it is never added to VCS. This way your appKey can be kept somehow secured.
- **appKey = your_key**
